## Exercise: Jquery

**NOTE** :- We are extremely against the copy-paste, Please proceed further only if you think you are really interested in this internship and try to solve the assignment by yourself. Take minimal help from the internet.

Build a listing page where users can add and rate examples from a category (e.g. movies, todo list, albums, blogs, or sports). 

This page should include the following:
1. A form, where you can add something to the list and rate it.
2. A table of all of the things you've added.
3. A delete button for each row of the table that lets you remove elements from the list.
4. BONUS: A sorting feature, so you can sort entries in the table by their title or their rating. (To implement this you may need to research JavaScript's sort method.)
5. All DOM manipulation should be done using jQuery - don't use any vanilla JavaScript properties or methods to interact with the DOM!

The below images are just examples of it/ You can try your own ideas, styling, designs, etc.

We will be focusing on the functionality more. 
It is necessary that the form should have all the functionalities mentioned in points 1, 2 & 3.


Points to note:
	
- Ideally, Write code in pure jquery without using any other frameworks.
- You don’t need to connect the frontend with any API or Backend services, just use any JSON file for fetching data, You can create your own JSON file or take one from here. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
- The code should work in the browser (this is not a nodeJS app).
- The operations/calculations should happen on change of any of the input fields (including the buttons).
- Bonus for styling - The components and the layout should be responsive over different dimensions. (Prefer bootstrap instead of CSS).

Complete your code in the <script> tag in the same file.

Upload the codes in your public GitHub repository and On completion,
